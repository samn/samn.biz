This pie crust recipe was passed down to me from my mother, who learned it from her mother, who learned it from a bottle of [corn oil](http://www.mazola.com/recipe/Oil_Pastry_-Pie_Crust-).

It's pretty forgiving, plant based, and quick.
While simple, it still produces some nice flaky layers in the crust.

If your kitchen is hot you can try putting the oil in freezer for 20 minutes before using it to keep the dough cool.

### Ingredients

* **1 3/4** cups all-purpose flour
* **1/2** teaspoon salt
* **1/2** cup vegetable oil (corn, soy, canola, etc)
* **3** tablespoons cold water

### Instructions
1. Mix dry ingredients in a bowl.
1. Add liquid ingredients and mix until the dough is formed.
1. Divide the dough into two equal balls.
1. Roll out each ball:
    * Place the ball in between two pieces of wax paper.
    _The dough will stick to other types of paper, like parchment paper_.
    * Roll out the dough until it's large enough to cover your pie.
1. Bake at 425 for 35-45 minutes. Cover the pie with foil if the top browns before the pie is ready.
