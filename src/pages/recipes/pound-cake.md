This simple cake has a bright lemony sweetness and is covered in a striking rhubarb-cardamom glaze.
The recipe calls for a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, but hand held egg beaters could be used instead.

If you're not fancy enough to have cake flour lying around you can make some using corn starch and regular old all-purpose flour.
Measure out all purpose flour, remove three tablespoons, and replace with three tablespoons of corn starch.

### Ingredients

**Cake**
* **1 1/4** cups (250 grams) sugar
* **4** large eggs, at room temperature
* **1 1/2** teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* **1 1/2** cups (170 grams) cake flour (bleached or unbleached)
* **1** teaspoon baking powder
* **1/2** teaspoon salt (I use fine sea salt)
* **2** sticks unsalted butter, melted and hot
* **1/4** cup poppy seeds
* **1/4** cup of lemon juice (about one lemon)
* Zest of two lemons

**Glaze**
* **1/4** cup lemon juice (about one lemon)
* **1/4** cup water
* **1/2** cup (confectioners) sugar
* **1/2** tablespoon cardamom pods (crushed with knife)
* **1/2** teaspoon cloves
* **1** rhubarb stalk (chopped)

### Instructions
1. Adjust the oven rack to middle position and heat oven to **350° F**. Grease and flour a 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pan, or line the bottom and all four sides with parchment. (You can use a 9 by 5 pan, but check for doneness 5 minutes early)
1. Put the *sugar*, *eggs*, and *vanilla* in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip until the mixture changes color and becomes lighter (at least 5 minutes).
1. While the eggs are beating:
    * Combine dry ingredients (*flour*, *baking powder*, *salt*) in a separate bowl.
1. When the egg mixture is ready:
    * With the mixer running, add the hot melted *butter* in a steady stream until incorporated.
    * Add *poppy seeds*, *lemon zest*, and lemon juice, and mix until combined.
1. Add *dry mixture* into the bowl in three parts, mixing until most of the flour is blended after each addition. After the last addition mix until just until there are no visible lumps or veins of flour (do not over stir).
1. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out nearly clean—with few crumbs clinging to it, *50 minutes to 1 hour*.
1. While baking, prepare the icing:
    * Combine icing incredients in a small sauce pan.
    * Bring to a boil, then simmer for *15 minutes*.
    * Strain out spices and rhubarb pulp, then set aside.
1. After removing the cake from the oven:
    * Let cool for a minute, then carefully remove cake and place on a cooling rack.
    * Poke small holes with a top pick across the top of the cake.
    * Use a pastry brush to cover the top and sides with the glaze.
    * Allow the glaze to be absorbed and repeat until the glaze is used up.
1. Allow cake to fully cool (about two hours) before serving.
